\textbf{Abstract}: Engineering schools are among the most popular colleges. Some of them like UM-SJTU JI are fond of interdisciplinarity. But should interdisciplinary just be applied within the realm of engineering? Many engineering students like music, should they be given the right to have professional music training in their own college? This paper is produced for the necessity of offering music courses in engineering school. Articles from reliable databases and some survey results done by the author are the main evidences. The main focuses are costs, music therapy and so on. The conclusion is that engineering schools should encourage students to take music courses by actually offering them, but they cannot be so strict with the GPA.
